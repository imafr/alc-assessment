# ALCAssessment

## Overview

The **ALCAssessment** project is a structured implementation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), LINQ queries, and SQL queries based on given assessment problems. This project demonstrates proficiency in C# (.NET Core), LINQ, and SQL with clean and maintainable code practices.

## Project Structure

## Additional Notes

- Each assessment problem contains **alternative solutions** (commented out) where applicable.
- Detailed explanations and personal insights are provided as comments in the code.

This project serves as a demonstration of my **C# (.NET Core), LINQ, and SQL skills** in a structured and efficient manner.
